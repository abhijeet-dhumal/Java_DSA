## About

This repository includes implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Java. Each implementation is accompanied by a detailed commented explanation . The goal is to provide clear, concise, and efficient implementations that can serve both as educational material and practical code for practicing DSA.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A code editor or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhijeet-dhumal/Java-DSA.git

- **`src/`**: Contains topic-wise source code of the data structures and algorithms using Java.

### Running the Code
To run any of the programs, navigate to the relevant directory and compile the Java files using the Java compiler (`javac`). Then, run the compiled classes using the Java interpreter (`java`).
Example:
```sh
cd src/P_08_Sorting/P_01_BubbleSort
javac C_01_BubbleSort.java
java C_01_BubbleSort
```
